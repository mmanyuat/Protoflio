To-Do App (Django) - Created by Mabuoc

Welcome to my personal To-Do App project! This app was built using Django as a solo effort to help manage daily tasks with a user-friendly interface and simple, effective functionality. It features user authentication, task management, and basic CRUD operations to help you stay organized and productive.

## Features

- User Authentication:
  - Users can sign up and log in to their accounts.
  - Passwords are securely stored and managed using Django's authentication system.
  
- Task Management:
  - Easily add, view, update, and delete tasks.
  - Each task includes a title and a status that can be toggled (completed or not).
  
 Clean Interface:
  - A simple yet effective design to help you stay on top of your tasks, without distractions.
  - Responsive and mobile-friendly, so you can manage tasks on any device.

## Technologies Used

- Django: The powerful web framework that powers the app.
- SQLite: The default database used for storing tasks (easy to switch to PostgreSQL for production).
- HTML, CSS: For creating the front-end interface.
- Gunicorn: A production-ready server to deploy the app.
